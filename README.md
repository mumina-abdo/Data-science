## Tupple

Tuple is a collection of elements which
Is ordered and unchangeable,they are used to store multiple items in single variable.They are immutable.

They are indexed.
Tuples are ordered.
These are immutable.
They can contain duplicate items.
To add an item in a Tuple you first convert it to a list,add the item to the list then convert the list to tuple since they cannot be added directly because of their immutability.


## Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the last-in,first-out principle (LIFO)
 the element that was inserted last will be removed first.
 When adding an item in a stack we use the push()operation.
This operation adds an item to the top of a stack.
